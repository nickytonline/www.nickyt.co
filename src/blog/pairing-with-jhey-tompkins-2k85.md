On <time datetime="2021-04-28">April 28th</time>, DEV Community member Jhey Tompkins joined @coffeecraftcode and I on the pairing stream to have some fun and help us build out a Twitch overlay using our mascot, Sloan!

### On this stream, we talked about:

* Sloan, DEV's awesome mascot!
* Twitch overlays
* ComfyJS (which allows folks to interact with a Twitch stream via chat commands)

Thanks again for coming on the stream, Jhey!
