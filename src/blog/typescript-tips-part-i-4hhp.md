We'll start off with the usual shameless plug of another blog post. If you haven't read it yet, check out my blog post, [Consider Using TypeScript](https://dev.to/nickytonline/why-you-might-want-to-consider-using-typescript-6j3).

We're going to look at a few tips that may/can help you on your journey in TypeScript land.

First let's start off with some things to remember if you're migrating a React application to TypeScript.

- When porting components to TypeScript, ensure that the file extension is `.tsx`, not `.ts`. If you don't, you'll be scratching your head for hours as to why JSX is not being recognized.

- Also, ensure that you have the `"jsx"` TypeScript compiler option set properly as well. By default, it's set to `"preserve"`. You want it to be set to `"react"`. e.g. [https://github.com/nickytonline/www.iamdeveloper.com/blob/master/tsconfig.json#L12](https://github.com/nickytonline/www.iamdeveloper.com/blob/master/tsconfig.json#L12)

- Create a reusable `children` prop and add it to your component props' type via an intersection.

   ```javascript
{% raw %}
   // some file housing the ChildrenProp
   export type ChildrenProp = { children: React.ReactNode };
      
   // some other component file that consumes it.
   export type SomeComponentProps = ChildrenProp & {
       someOtherProp: boolean;
       ...
   };
   ```

- Bonus points, make it generic with a default, [https://github.com/nickytonline/www.iamdeveloper.com/blob/master/types/children-prop.d.ts](https://github.com/nickytonline/www.iamdeveloper.com/blob/master/types/children-prop.d.ts)


Alright, let's move on to outside of React Land.

- If you're not sure what the shape of something you're building is yet, or you're consuming something that for whatever reason you don't know the shape, you're going to type it as `any` until you start to figure things out. If you're using TypeScript 3.0 and up, don't. Prefer the `unknown` type.

You get all the benefits of the `any` type, but as soon as you try to access anything on the object, you will need to do a type assertion. For more information, see the documentation on the [`unknown`](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2018/07/30/announcing-typescript-3-0/#the-unknown-type) type

   Here's a [TypeScript Playgound](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#src=type%20SomeType%20%3D%20%7B%0D%0A%20%20noYolo%3A%20string%3B%0D%0A%20%20dontNo%3A%20string%3B%0D%0A%7D%0D%0A%0D%0A%2F%2F%20unknown%20complains%20about%20everything%0D%0Aconst%20someObject%3A%20unknown%20%3D%20%7B%0D%0A%20%20noYolo%3A%20'hi'%2C%0D%0A%20%20dontNo%3A%20'%3F'%0D%0A%7D%0D%0A%0D%0Aconsole.log(someObject.noYolo%20!%3D%3D%20undefined)%3B%20%2F%2F%20TS%20Complains%2C%20no%20dice%0D%0A%0D%0A%2F%2F%20We're%20sure%20of%20the%20shape%2C%20or%20some%20other%20kind%20of%20type%20checking%20done%20here%0D%0Aconsole.log((%3CSomeType%3EsomeObject).noYolo)%3B%0D%0A%0D%0A%2F%2F%20any%20on%20the%20other%20hand...%0D%0Aconst%20someOtherObject%3A%20any%20%3D%20%7B%0D%0A%20%20yolo%3A%20'yolo!'%0D%0A%7D%0D%0A%0D%0A%2F%2F%20YOLO%0D%0Aconsole.log(someOtherObject.yolo)%3B%0D%0A%0D%0A) example if you want to see it in action.

- Sometimes you have code where you know something is going to exist no matter what, so you don't want to have a check to see if it's null or undefined. TypeScript allows you via the `!` operator to basically say, "Hey TypeScript, trust me, I know what I'm doing.".

For example, instead of doing this

{% endraw %}
```javascript
const someElementReference = document.querySelector('.awesome-selector');

if (someElementReference) {
  someElementReference.setAttribute('data-i-checked-first', `I wasn't sure if you'd exist`);
}
```
{% raw %}

you could do this

{% endraw %}
```javascript
const someElementReference = document.querySelector('.awesome-selector');

someElementReference!.setAttribute('data-yolo', `I know what I'm doing!`);
```

Use this sparingly because, well, this giphy.

That's all for now, until part II. I said it, so I need to write it now. 😉
