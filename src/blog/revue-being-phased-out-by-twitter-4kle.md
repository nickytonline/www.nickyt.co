If you're like me, you may have jumped on the let me integrate Revue with my Twitter to better surface my newsletter train.

Using Revue has helped increase my readership, but unfortunately it looks they are [phasing it out at the end of the year](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/03/twitter-layoffs-elon-musk/), so I started exporting my subscribers yesterday.

I decided to go back to [buttondown.email](https://buttondown.email) which is what I was using before I was trying out Substack, then Revue.

If you're currently using Revue, I advise to do the same. If you do, where do you plan to move your newsletter to? If you're not sure where, there are a bunch of great suggestions in this thread.
