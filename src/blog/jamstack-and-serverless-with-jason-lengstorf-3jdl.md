On <time datetime="2021-04-21">April 21st</time>, Jason Lengstorf (VP of Developer Experience at [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) and DEV Community member) joined @coffeecraftcode and I on the Walkthrough Wednesday stream to discuss Jamstack, serverless, and Jamstack Explorers.

We used Netlify's serverless functions to quickly set up an API to grab DEV posts with the DEV API.

Thanks again for joining us, Jason! 😎 I had a great time pairing with you on the stream.

### On this stream, we covered:

* [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)
* [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) and how to quickly deploy and update our API
* [Netlify On-demand builders](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/on-demand-builders/)
* [The DEV API](https://docs.forem.com/api/)
* [Jamstack Explorers](https://explorers.netlify.com/) - We forgot to cover this one, but Christina gave it a shoutout at the end of the stream. It's really good. I did the NEXT.js course with @cassidoo a little while back. 😎
