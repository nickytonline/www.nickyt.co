On <time datetime="2021-02-03">February 3rd</time>, DEV Community member Dan Ott joined Christina and I on the pairing stream to work on a CSS issue related to Flexbox gap not being supported in Safari.

Here is the issue that we were working on:

### On this stream, we covered:

* Replacing flexbox with CSS grid in certain areas of the site so that grid gap could be used
* CSS grid features
* How awesome CSS is
