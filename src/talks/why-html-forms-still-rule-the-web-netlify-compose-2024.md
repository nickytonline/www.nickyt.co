Developers sometimes underestimate the power of CSS for building visually appealing and accessible forms. By using form-specific pseudo-classes like :focus, :hover, :invalid, and :valid, we can enhance the user experience without overcomplicating things by resorting to custom JavaScript. This not only simplifies code but also ensures a consistent user experience across browsers and devices, reinforcing the core strengths of HTML forms.
