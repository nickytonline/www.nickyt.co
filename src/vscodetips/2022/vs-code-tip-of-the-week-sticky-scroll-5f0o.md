This week's VS Code Tip of the Week is the new sticky scroll functionality.

The nice thing about this feature is as you scroll, you have the context to where you are in the code because the sections stick at the top, e.g. a class definition, method definition, etc.

This is a feature you need to enable. Open your VS Code settings and search for `sticky`. Ensure Editor › Experimental › Sticky Scroll is enabled.
