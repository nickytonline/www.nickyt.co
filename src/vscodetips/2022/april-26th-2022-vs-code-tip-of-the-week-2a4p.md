This week’s VS Code tip of the week is coming a day late. I’m still ramping up at my new job and completely forgot to post this yesterday. 🙃

It’s been around for a bit now, but you can create a terminal in the integrated terminal panel called the JavaScript debug terminal.

![Drop down to select a terminal type in the VS Code Intergrated terminal panel. The currently selected item is JavaScript Debug Terminal](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/images/posts/_uploads_articles_hhrwv6xq3m9xn9xfpj47.png)
 

What this gives you is the easiest way to start a debug session for Node.js. Run an npm script that runs something Node.js and it will attach the debugger automatically for you. Same goes for running a file via e.g. `node index.js`

You can read more about the [JavaScript debug terminal in the official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_javascript-debug-terminal).

Happy VS Coding!
