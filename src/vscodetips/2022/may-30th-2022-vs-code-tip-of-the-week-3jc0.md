This week's tip of the week is care of Justin Noel. Justin is in my Virtual Coffee community. Yesterday, during a Lunch & Learn we had, he mentioned that you can search in only a specific folder in VS Code. I was completely unaware of this.

The flow with your mouse is to right-click on the folder and select `Find in Folder...`

![Context menu open on a folder with the option Find in Folder... highlighted](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/images/posts/_uploads_articles_wyutoaledg7ltso400wu.png)
 
You can also have focus on a folder in the sidebar and then do <kbd>⌥</kbd> (Option) + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> for macOS or <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> for any other operating system supported by VS Code.

Both will bring you to the search panel but notice that now it only includes any files in the given folder.

Great tip Justin, and Happy VS Coding!
