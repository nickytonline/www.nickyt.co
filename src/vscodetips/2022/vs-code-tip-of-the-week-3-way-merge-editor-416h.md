If you haven't already, grab the [June 2022 Release of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69)! If you're on Insiders, then there's nothing you need to do.

There are all kinds of goodies in the release, but this week's tip is a new feature that landed in VS Code. The [3-way Merge Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#_3-way-merge-editor). 🔥

One thing you'll need to do to enable it is add `git.mergeEditor: true` to your user settings. If you prefer the GUI for settings, then navigate to the git section.
