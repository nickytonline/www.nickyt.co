This week's VS Code Tip of the Week is care of Matt Bierner. Matt always has amazing tips, so I highly recommend giving him a follow on Twitter.

I'm a big fan of inlay hints, but sometimes they can get in the way. Matt goes through a few ways on how you can configure them to make them less annoying.

Thanks for the tip Matt!
