On <time datetime="2021-05-26">May 26th</time>, DEV Community member Meg Gutshall joined @coffeecraftcode and me on the pairing stream to work on an issue in regard to the `link` liquid tag. 

{% github "https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/11880" %}

Watch the pairing session with Meg below to catch up on what you missed:

### On this stream, we:

* Talked about what a liquid tag is
* Dug into some code related to liquid tags in general
* Found a solution for the issue we tackled

Meg is currently working on a pull request to fix it

{% github "https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/13928" %}

Thanks again for coming on the stream, Meg. I’m looking forward to seeing the fix in production!
