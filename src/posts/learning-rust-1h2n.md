My awesome coworker @citizen428 dropped a new resource for learning the Rust language care of Microsoft. It's called [Get started with Rust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/rust-first-steps/).

I keep saying to myself that I want to learn Rust, so I'm killing two birds with one stone, since I [wanted to start streaming again](https://dev.to/nickytonline/my-twitch-stream-setup-2m0c) on [my own stream](https://livecoding.ca), and not just the [DEV stream](https://twitch.tv/thepracticaldev). 😎

This is the inaugural post of my series on learning the Rust language.

<em>I'd love it</em> if you popped by on my stream on Tuesdays at 4pm UTC (noon Eastern for me) so we can learn together.

If you aren't already subscribed to my Twitch and YouTube channels, what are you waiting for? 😎

Update 2022: I've finished this so you can check out the replay if you're interested in the course as well.
