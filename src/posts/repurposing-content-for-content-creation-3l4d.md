So I've been [streaming on Twitch](https://livecoding.ca) since July 2020, blogging, and [given some talks](https://iamdeveloper.com/talks). To keep on with the "learning in public" theme and content creation, I've started a podcast called Nick's Cuts, [pod.iamdeveloper.com](https://pod.iamdeveloper.com).

So what is it all about?

> A podcast that is mainly tech related. It's conversations I've had on my Twitch stream, livecoding.ca, with awesome people and maybe some other things.

That's the TL; DR. It's not exactly the [Swyx Mixtape](https://mixtape.swyx.io/) format from Shawn Wang, @swyx, but I did take inspiration from it.

Another reason I started the podcast is to continue my content creation journey. I work full-time as an engineer, so my time for content creation is limited to some degree. I stream during my lunch hour and do editing in the evenings when I have time.

Aside from saving me time from creating new content, repurposing content allows me to expand the reach of some of my content. For example, some friends can't always catch my Twitch streams.

I also put time into editing my transcripts because even the transcripts can become content. For example, I used the transcript from a highlight from one stream as a blog post.

I'm still no pro at content creation, but folks in the space do like the concept of repurposing content.

I even came across a post about this topic from my co-worker [Jason Lengstorf](https://dev.to/jlengstorf), a little while back titled [Turn 1 piece of dev content into 10+ — use the buffalo stick](https://www.jason.af/effective-devrel-buffalo-stick/).

If you're a content creator, I'm curious about what your thoughts are on this or what other strategies you have for content creation.
